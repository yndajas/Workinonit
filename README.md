# Workinonit
Search for jobs and keep track of your applications in one simple but powerful web app!

With Workinonit, you can:
- find jobs by keywords (e.g. job title) and location
- add jobs by URL or manual entry
- keep track of your progress on job applications
- save and review feedback from and notes on companies

You can view a demo of the app over on YouTube: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nK35Tuxfkso" target="_blank" title="app demo on YouTube">youtube.com/watch?v=nK35Tuxfkso</a>. [PLACEHOLDER - TO BE AMENDED]

## Online use

The app is available to use for free at <a href="http://workinonit.yndajas.co">workinonit.yndajas.co</a> (link will redirect to Heroku)!

## Local use

You can run a copy of the app offline for local use. After cloning or downloading the repository, follow the instructions below.

### Installation

The following instructions are for Windows Subsystem for Linux/Ubuntu, but it's also possible to run the app on other systems. The only difference should be the method for starting the PostgreSQL server - I don't have instructions for this, but <a href="https://www.postgresql.org" target="_blank">check the PostgreSQL website</a> for more information.

Install Ruby (<a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation" target="_blank" title="Ruby installation">help</a>), then in a terminal:
1. `gem install bundler`
2. change directory to Workinonit (e.g. `cd /mnt/c/Users/yndaj/Documents/GitHub/Workinonit`, replacing the path with wherever you've downloaded/moved the repository)
3. `bundle install`
4. if you don't have PostgreSQL installed: `sudo apt-get install postgresql`
5. `sudo service postgresql start` (if you get an error saying a user doesn't exist, try the following first, changing '<USERNAME>' to the username mentioned in the error: `sudo -u postgres createuser --superuser <USERNAME>`)
6. `rake resetdb` - or, if you want to start with a clean database (no test data), run `rake db:drop`, `rake db:create` and `rake db:migrate`

### Usage

In a terminal:
1. Make sure you're in the Workinonit directory (via `cd`)
2. `rails s`
3. the penultimate line that appears after you execute `rails s` should contain an address like tcp://localhost:3000 - open this address in your browser to start using Workinonit!
